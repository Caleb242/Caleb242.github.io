    "text": "During the 2023-2024 men’s college basketball season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers ranked within the top 70 in total rebounds. They worked hard to dominate on the defensive end and it paid off ranking within the top 20. Their issue? Getting second chances on the offensive side. Nebraska ranked 241st in Division one basketball in offensive rebounding and struggled in their biggest moments which led to an early exit in the tournament.\nThe question is: How can you dominate but also struggle doing the exact same thing but opposite ends of the court?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n#| message: FALSE\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"logs24.csv\")\nbig_ten_data &lt;- basketball %&gt;%\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Team) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Offensive_Rebounds = sum(TeamOffRebounds, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Total_Rebounds = sum(TeamTotalRebounds, na.rm = TRUE), \n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Rebounds), desc(Total_Offensive_Rebounds))  \nwaffle_data &lt;- big_ten_data %&gt;%\n  select(Team, Total_Rebounds, Total_Offensive_Rebounds) %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"Rebound_Type\", value = \"Rebounds\", Total_Rebounds, Total_Offensive_Rebounds) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Rebounds))\nnu2 &lt;- c(\"Total Rebounds\"=1176, \"Offensive Rebounds\"=277)\nwi2 &lt;- c(\"Total Rebounds\"=1106, \"Offensive Rebounds\"=309)\n\niron(\n waffle(nu2/2, \n        rows = 11, \n        title=\"Nebraska's Total Rebounds vs Offensive Rebounds\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 2 rebounds\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n        ),\n waffle(wi2/2, \n        rows = 11, \n         title=\"Wisconsin's Total Rebounds vs Offensive Rebounds\", \n        xlab = \"1 square = 2 rebounds\",\n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\"),\n      \n        )\n        \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnu&lt;-c(\"Total Rebounds\"= 1176, \"Offensive Rebounds\"= 277, 273)\npu&lt;-c(\"Total Rebounds\"= 1335, \"Offensive Rebounds\"=391)\niron(\n waffle(nu/2, \n        rows = 13, \n        title=\"Nebraska's Total Rebounds vs Offensive Rebounds\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 2 rebounds\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")\n        ),\n waffle(pu/2, \n        rows = 13, \n         title=\"Purdue's Total Rebounds vs Offensive Rebounds\", \n        xlab = \"1 square = 2 rebounds\",\n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\"),\n       )\n)"
